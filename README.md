# LLM Brainscan

A _Cybernetic Studio_ project.

## Description

Do LLMs dream of electric anything? At one level the answer is "clearly
no---that's ridiculous anthropomorphising".

However, an LLM is a machine learning model, and machine learning models have
lots of parameters (in the form of "grids" of numbers called matrices) and these
parameters are updated by a learning algorithm. So in a sense, the model is
"changing its mind" as it learns. And the model is "thinking" in the sense that
it is processing data and making predictions.

Again, I know this is nothing like how human brains work. But if we suspend
disbelief a bit it's fun to think of "scanning the LLM's brain" while it does
its thing.
